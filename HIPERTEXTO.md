# A Summary of Blogging  
Blogging boomed in the 2000s but lost ground as social media like *Facebook* and *Twitter* grew. While platforms like WordPress survived, many early blogging tools faded away.  

Nowadays, bloggers choose between platforms (*Medium*, *BearBlog*) or technical setups like static site generators. Both work best on computers, but thereâ€™s a simpler path for our phone-centric world.  

## Mobile-Friendly Blogging  
Most blogging tools still need coding skills or lock you into platforms. What about people who just have phones? **Hipertexto** aims to solve this: write in apps you already use (*Apple Notes*, *Google Keep*), and publish directly to your own website.

No tech headaches. No complex setups. We aim to help everyone create their own space online, with easy instructions in multiple languages.  

## Not the First, But Building Forward

## Blogging from Your Files  
Prefer organizing thoughts in folders? Try these:

Blogging began as a way to share ideas freely. Hipertexto keeps this spirit alive â€“ making it effortless to own your corner of the internet, even from your phone.
